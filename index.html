          <h1><p>Kastamonu</p></h1>
          <p>
            The city is believed to have been founded in the 18th century BC.
            <br />
            The town was known as Timonion (Τιμόνιον in Greek) during the Roman
            <br />
            period.[citation needed] The change of name of the town dates to the
            tenth century AD. <br />
            Manuel Erotikos Komnenos, a prominent general and the father of
            thebr
            <br />
            Byzantine emperor Isaac I Komnenos, was given lands around Kastamonu
            <br />
            by Emperor Basil II and built a fortress there named Kastra Komnenon
            <br />
            br (Κάστρα Κομνηνῶν). Manuel came to the notice of Basil II because
            of his defence, in 978, of Nicaea against the rebel <br />
            Skleros.[7] The name Kastra Komnenon was shortened to Kastamone, and
            <br />
            later turkified to Kastamoni and Kastamonu. Ibn Battuta visited the
            city, noting it as "one of the largest and finest cities, where
            <br />
            commodities are abundant and prices low." He stayed here forty
            <br />
            days.[8] The famous Sufi saint of the city is Shaykh Shaban Veli
            (Şaban-ı Veli in Turkish, d. 976 AH/1569 AD).[9][10] The <br />
            Dress Code Revolution of Kemal Atatürk started on August 23, 1925,
            <br />
            at Kastamonu. Atatürk made his historical speech concerning the "Hat
            and <br />
            Dress Revolution" during his visit to Kastamonu in 1925 in the
            Republican People's Party building.[11] The building is now used as
            <br />
            the Archeological Museum of Kastamonu. The possessions used by
            <br />
            Atatürk in his Kastamonu visit are also exhibited in the museum.
